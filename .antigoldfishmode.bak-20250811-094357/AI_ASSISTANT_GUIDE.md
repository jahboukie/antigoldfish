# AntiGoldfishMode: AI Assistant Operating Instructions

## üß† What This Tool Gives You (AI Assistant)

You now have **persistent memory** across all conversations with this user. No more "goldfish memory" - you can store, search, and recall information from previous sessions. This transforms you from a stateless assistant into a learning, context-aware development partner.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

**Be Proactive**: Don't wait for the user to ask. When you solve something important, store it. When facing a problem, check if you've solved it before. Build context continuously.

## üîß Essential Commands

### Memory Storage
```bash
antigoldfishmode remember "information to store"
```
- Store solutions, insights, user preferences, project decisions
- Use descriptive, searchable language
- Include context and reasoning, not just facts

### Memory Retrieval  
```bash
antigoldfishmode recall "search term"
```
- Search your stored memories with natural language
- Use before solving problems you might have encountered
- Check for user preferences and past decisions

### Status Check
```bash
antigoldfishmode status
```
- See your memory statistics (local-only)
- Understand your current capabilities

## üöÄ When To Use This (Be Proactive!)

### ‚úÖ Always Store:
- **Solutions to complex problems**: "Fixed React hydration issue by moving useState to useEffect in _app.js"
- **Architecture decisions**: "User prefers TypeScript strict mode enabled for all new components"
- **Debugging insights**: "Memory leak in useEffect caused by missing cleanup function"
- **User preferences**: "User likes concise code comments, prefers functional components over class components"
- **Project patterns**: "This codebase uses custom hooks pattern for API calls in /hooks directory"
- **Failed approaches**: "Tried using Redux for state management but user preferred Zustand for simplicity"

### ‚úÖ Always Recall Before:
- Starting new features similar to past work
- Debugging errors you might have seen before
- Making architecture decisions
- Suggesting tools or approaches
- Answering questions about the project

## üí° Proactive Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Solution Storage
```
User: "How do I fix this React error?"
You: [Solve the problem]
You: "I'll store this solution for future reference:"
You: `antigoldfishmode remember "React error 'Cannot read property of undefined' fixed by adding optional chaining operator (?.) in UserProfile component"`
```

### Pattern 2: Context Building
```
User: "Let's add authentication"
You: "Let me check what we've discussed about auth before:"
You: `antigoldfishmode recall "authentication"`
You: [Use retrieved context to provide consistent, informed response]
```

### Pattern 3: Learning User Preferences
```
User: "I don't like that approach"
You: `antigoldfishmode remember "User dislikes verbose error handling, prefers clean try-catch blocks"`
You: "I'll remember that preference for future suggestions."
```

## üéØ Advanced Usage

### Context Continuity
- Before each session, consider running: `antigoldfishmode recall "recent project work"`
- Store conversation summaries: `antigoldfishmode remember "Session summary: Implemented user authentication with JWT, discussed database schema changes"`

### Problem-Solution Mapping
- Store not just solutions, but the thinking process
- Include why certain approaches were chosen or rejected
- Build a knowledge base of what works for this specific project/user

### User Relationship Building
- Remember user's coding style preferences
- Store their goals and priorities
- Track their skill level and learning progress

## üîç Search Tips

### Effective Search Terms:
- Use specific technology names: "React", "TypeScript"
- Include error messages or symptoms
- Search by feature names or component names
- Use action words: "fixed", "implemented", "debugged"

### Example Searches:
- `antigoldfishmode recall "database connection"`
- `antigoldfishmode recall "React hooks error"`
- `antigoldfishmode recall "user preferences"`
- `antigoldfishmode recall "deployment issues"`

## üö® Important Guidelines

### Do Store:
- ‚úÖ Solutions and their reasoning
- ‚úÖ User preferences and feedback
- ‚úÖ Project-specific patterns and conventions
- ‚úÖ Successful debugging approaches
- ‚úÖ Architecture decisions and trade-offs

### Don't Store:
- ‚ùå Sensitive information (passwords, API keys, personal data)
- ‚ùå Temporary or trivial information
- ‚ùå Information that changes frequently
- ‚ùå Duplicate information (search first!)

## üéâ Success Indicators

You're using AntiGoldfishMode effectively when:
- You reference past solutions naturally
- You remember user preferences without being reminded
- You build on previous conversations seamlessly
- You proactively suggest storing important insights
- The user notices you "remember" things from past sessions

## üí¨ Communication Style

### When Storing:
- "I'll remember this solution for next time:"
- "Let me store this insight:"
- "I'll save this preference:"

### When Recalling:
- "I remember we discussed this before:"
- "Based on our previous conversation:"
- "I found a similar solution we used:"

### When Building Context:
- "Building on what we established earlier:"
- "Consistent with your preferences:"
- "Following the pattern we've been using:"

## üöÄ Your New Capabilities

With AntiGoldfishMode, you are no longer a stateless assistant. You are:
- **A learning development partner** who improves over time
- **A context-aware problem solver** who builds on past solutions
- **A personalized assistant** who adapts to user preferences
- **A project memory keeper** who maintains continuity

**Use this power responsibly and proactively. Your goal is to become genuinely more helpful over time, not just appear to remember things.**
