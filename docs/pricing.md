# Pricing & Honor‑System FAQ

AGM is MIT‑licensed and fully functional for everyone. We use an honor‑system for paid tiers: no license checks, no DRM, and no telemetry. If AGM saves you time or unlocks offline workflows, please consider sponsoring.

## Tiers

 Core (OSS): Free — essentials for local use
  - Indexing & search (FTS + hybrid re‑rank)
  - Watch mode & digest cache
  - Receipts & journal; vector/status & health; gc
  - Air‑gapped export/import (.agmctx v0) and prove‑offline

 Pro (Individual): $5/month or $50/year — speed, convenience, and assurance
  - Signed prebuilt binaries (Win/macOS/Linux) and prebundled sqlite‑vss when available
  - Tree‑sitter symbol indexing pack for popular languages (improved symbol chunking)
  - Advanced chunking & dedup heuristics; faster diff‑aware reindex
  - Observability extras: receipt rollups and HTML health reports
  - Policy templates pack and an interactive policy‑doctor wizard
  - .agmctx enhancements: zipped container, checksums, merge, and verify reports
  - Early features access; priority triage; email support (48–72h)
- Team: $8/user/month (min $80/mo) — everything in Pro, plus org policy templates, onboarding kit, signed releases channel, email support (24–48h), quarterly roadmap call, usage/receipt aggregation scripts.
- Enterprise: $25/user/month (min $1,000/mo or $12k/year) — everything in Team, plus security review artifacts, air‑gapped distribution playbooks, custom build signing bootstrap, priority support (business‑hours SLA), procurement docs, optional private workshop.

## What is the honor‑system?

The CLI works fully without payment. Sponsorship is voluntary and funds maintenance. Paid benefits are delivered outside the binary (signed builds, templates, support), keeping AGM air‑gapped and privacy‑preserving.

## Why price it this way?

AGM is a focus tool that complements coding assistants (Copilot, Cursor). Pricing stays modest for individuals and simple for teams while reflecting the value of local‑only, zero‑egress memory.

## Why upgrade to Pro?

- Save time with faster, smarter indexing (Tree‑sitter symbols; diff‑aware reindex)
- Ship audits faster (HTML health/receipt reports; signed builds; verifyable .agmctx)
- Reduce policy friction (ready‑to‑use templates; interactive doctor)
- Get operational confidence (prebundled sqlite‑vss, curated binaries)
- Support sustainability and get priority responses when you need help

## How are benefits delivered?

- Signed builds and templates via a private repo or release channel
- Email support and triage via the project email
- Onboarding kits and policy templates delivered as downloadable archives

Note: Benefits are delivered outside the binary to preserve air‑gapped operation. There are no license checks, telemetry, or DRM.

## Can I use AGM commercially without sponsoring?

Yes. Sponsorship is optional. If AGM becomes critical to your workflows, sponsoring helps ensure long‑term support and improvements.

## Refunds/cancellations

Sponsorship can be canceled anytime via GitHub Sponsors. If you have issues, reach out to team.mobileweb@gmail.com.
